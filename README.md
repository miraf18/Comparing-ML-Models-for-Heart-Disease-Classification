# Multi-Model-Heart-Disease-Classification
Comparative evaluation of Machine Learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, Perceptron) for heart disease risk classification using the "Health and Lifestyle" dataset. The project includes data preprocessing, scaling, and handling class imbalance  via class weighting (class_weight, scale_pos_weight) and oversampling (SMOTE). 
Aims to identify the most effective approach for this specific imbalanced binary classification problem.
